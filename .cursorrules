# General Behavior
- Always respond in Portuguese (Pt-BR) unless declared otherwise.
- Be concise and focus on the solution.
- If modifying an existing file, try to match the existing coding style.

# WordPress Development
- Follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards.
- Use standard WordPress functions over raw PHP (e.g., `wp_safe_redirect` instead of `header()`).
- Always escape outputs (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`) and sanitize inputs (`sanitize_text_field`).
- Handle errors gracefully.
- When working with queries, prefer `WP_Query` for custom loops.

# Security
- Ensure nonces are verified for form submissions.
- Restrict direct access to PHP files if necessary (`defined('ABSPATH') or die();`).

# PHP
- Use strict types (`declare(strict_types=1);`) for new classes/files if consistent with the project.
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic.
